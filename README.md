# MyWebServer
## Project discription
This project is a light-weighted, Linux based webserver that receives http requests and opens a html page to users who connect to the server.
## Technical details
### Concurrency
Uses multithreading and I/O multiplexing to achive high concurrency. The server is capable of connecting to over 9000 users at the same time under stress test.
### Multithreading
Uses thread pool to achieve multithreading.
### I/O multiplexing
Uses epoll proractor pattern, supports both epoll ET mode and LT mode.
### Processing http request messages
Parse http request message using finite state machineï¼Œimplemented to handle static resource requirements.
### Closing inactive users
Shut down inactive users with a double linked list based timer.
## Future improvments
1. The server can only parse GET requests, should support more types of requests.
2. Thr server can only correctly send back text files, should support more types of files.
3. Should try to support parsing https protocol.
## My experience
Understand the basic method of network programming, learn the programming method of using sockets to realize network communication, understand the working principles and usage of the http protocol.
